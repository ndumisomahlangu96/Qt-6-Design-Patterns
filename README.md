# Qt-6-Design-Patterns
A software design pattern describes a reusable solution to a commonly needed behavior in software.[1] A design pattern is not a rigid structure to be copied directly into source code. Rather, it is a description of and a template for solving a particular type of problem that can be used in many different contexts, including different programming languages and computing platforms.[2] Design patterns can be viewed as formalized best practices that the programmer may use to solve common problems when designing software.

Object-oriented design patterns typically show relationships and interactions between classes or objects, without specifying the final application classes or objects that are involved.[citation needed] Patterns that imply mutable state may be unsuited for functional programming languages. Some patterns can be rendered unnecessary in languages that have built-in support for solving the problem they are trying to solve, and object-oriented patterns are not necessarily suitable for non-object-oriented languages.
